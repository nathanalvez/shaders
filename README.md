Shaders created from a challenge.

I used this link for consulting hlsl functions and sub graphs for do this challenge.

In scene named 'Shaders', i used an character model named Maria. I decide to use her for a good demonstration of shaders i made. All shaders were created using ShaderGraph, i think it the fast way to edit, create and testing shaders. In this challenge, i focused on calm and fun process, and it afected the velocity of total process. 

I had a chill and fun process and i hope this is enough. I hope you are well and have a nice day.
