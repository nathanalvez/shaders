Shaders made for a challenge.

I consulted the link below for hlsl functions and sub graphs to perform this challenge.

In 'Shaders' scene, I used a character model named Maria. I decide to use her for a good demonstration of shaders I made. 

All shaders were created using ShaderGraph, which I think it's a fast way to edit, create and test shaders. At this challenge, I focused on enjoying the process and it afected the total speed.

I had a good time developing it and I hope this is enough. Best regards and have a nice day.
